A hybrid refresher/exploratory project to build a small application, containerize it, automate its deployment, make it observable, and make it resilient.


Todo (unordered):
- DB migration to add a last modified column to tables
- Break monitor route into get, update, add and delete funtions
- Test suite for API
- Simple frontend (in progress)
- API documentation
